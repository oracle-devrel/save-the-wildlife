## The power of Cloud Native on Oracle Cloud

In this workshop, you will learn how to deploy a simple multiplayer [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) application to the cloud, then iterate through the modernization process to enhance the application and ultimately deploy it to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) with CI/CD, Terraform, Kustomize, Coherence and Redis as a base line backend to run applications that require in-memory concurrency management. In our case we are using

## Getting Started

This workshop leverages a broad array of OCI services to illustrate how to deploy, migrate, and modernize applications in the cloud. 

You can start with app modernization journey and follow a stet by step guide on VM deployment via Terraform, then containerize the application and move to OCI Container Instances. 
In the final phase, the application design is enhanced to provide scalability while being deployed to Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE). The best part is, you get to play a really cool 3D "Save the Wildlife" game when you finish the deployment.

Or you can dive (pun intended) into the ocean of DevOPS CI/CD and release our [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) minigame as many times as you like.

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of cloud and database terms is helpful
- Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is helpful
- Familiarity with the OCI console
- Basic familiarity with app containerization
- Basic familiarity with OCI Container Instances
- Basic familiarity with OKE
